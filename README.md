# foreground_paper_scripts
This folder contains the code needed to generate the data and plots for the foreground paper. 
First, copy this repository to your account on Coconut.
Then, run ./generate_data.sh on the command line to get the data needed to make the plots. This will take roughly an hour to run and will save a bunch of files in your folder.
Finally, run python generate_plots.py on the command line to generate all the plots using the saved data.
